Project: Oyster Database
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Create a database website that will allow a user to track the different types of oysters they have eaten and add more at any given time. 

Software: SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask

Reason: I wanted to test my ability to design things in Fusion and thought that creating a figure with joints would provide a fun challenge since the measurements and design would neeed to be very precise in order for it to funciton properly. 

Plan: 
        1. Define the details that will be stored in the database. 
        2. Create the database file using SQL and define the base table with those variables.
        3. Create a basic layout for all of the HTML files (layout.html) in this project.
        4. Utilzing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create an HTML file (index.html) that will display all the table values in a digestible way for the user.
        5. Add a search feature to this file that uses the name of the oyster as its search variable.
        6. Within the index webpage, give the user buttons that will send them to a Favorites webpage (favorites.html), or Add webpage (add.html). 
        7. Code the Favorites webapge that will diplay all of the oysters where the user has "favorited" them.
        8. Code the Add webapge that will allow the user to add new oysters to the database.
